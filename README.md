# MontserratGreek
A fork of Montserrat Regular by Google Fonts with Greek support (including Greek Extended (the polytonic glyphs used in Ancient Greek). Be careful, only regular weight is included. More weights coming soon. I have also modified the "π" to look better. This was designed in response to multiple requests by users.

*NOTES: 

1. The polytonic accents look somewhat out of shape because the accented letters were generated using FontForge’s “Build Accented Glyph” feature that put some accents WAY out of place, therefore quick manual adjustments were made. 

2. There are some kerning issues with some characters which need to be fixed.

3. In order to fit with the breathing marks' height, the Greek grave and acute accents, were made taller. *The Latin ones remain unchanged*.

Based on version 7.210. Also adjusted Cyrillic Ѳ (wrong bar location) and Ф (descending below baseline).

Sample images below are the following:

1. Main Glyphs

2. Sample text - Greek Wikipedia article about Greek language

3. Sample text - Lord's Prayer in Ancient Greek
